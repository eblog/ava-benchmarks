Install
=======

Install GTI SDK from
https://dev.gyrfalcontech.ai/software-downloads/

We tested GTI SDK (2803) 4.4.0.3. The newer version (e.g.,
4.5.0.3 at the time of writing) should also work.

Generate API server and guest library using
`$AVA_ROOT/cava/samples/gti.nw.cpp`.

Environment
===========

Setup environment variables for GTI SDK and AvA:

```
export GTISDKROOT=/path/to/compiled/gtisdk
export AVA_ROOT=/path/to/ava/source/tree
```

`AVA_CHANNEL` and `AVA_WPOOL` are set in the same way as other
benchmarks.

Demo benchmarks
===============

Simply run `benchmark.sh` in the following two benchmark
directories:

* liteDemo
* PipelineDemo
